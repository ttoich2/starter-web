## Introduction
Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.
Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Vito, how do you like my little angel? Isn't she beautiful? You can act like a man! Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.

## How to Contribute
What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. It's not personal. It's business.

## Deployment
Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind.

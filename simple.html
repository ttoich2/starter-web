			Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship.

I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public?
